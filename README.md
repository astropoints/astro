# Astropoints
Astropoints are a schema for user story complexity estimation. Based on traditional “Story Points”, Astropoints provide a non-biased visual representation of complexity which enables consistent messaging across teams of various experience, background, etc.
# Why use Astropoints?
There are three main reasons for using Astropoints:
1. Non-numeric representation of complexity is less intimidating to new user story users and provides a visual representation which may be easier to consume than numbers.
2. Other visual representations of user story complexity depend on cultural (such as t-shirt size) or exterior knowledge (such as dog breeds) that are not always understood across boundaries.
3. By using a visual representation with differentiation between each item in the schema, visual representations of work can be readily understood and used for improvement.
# What are the Astropoints mappings to Story Points?
From least to most complexity, they are
1. Comet: 1 Story Point equivalent. A story that is very small and quickly done.
2. Moon: 2 Story Points equivalent. A story with a small amount of complexity.
3. Earth: 3 Story Points equivalent. A story with average complexity. 
4. Jupiter: 5 Story Points equivalent. A story with larger-than-average complexity.
5. Sun: 8 Story Points equivalent. A story with the largest complexity that is reasonably understood.
6. Solar System: 13 Story Points equivalent. A story that is very complex and likely should be broken down further.
7. Constellation: 20 Story Points equivalent. The most complex-but-still-valid story imaginable.
8. Milky Way Galaxy: 40 Story Points equivalent. This is too big for a single story!
